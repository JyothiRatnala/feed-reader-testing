# Feed Reader Testing

* This project tested my ability to use a testing suite, like Jasmine, to validate my code. We started with a Feed Reader App and were required to write test spec in Jasmine.

## Steps to run application

 * To start the app, open index.html in your browser.

 * The tests were written in the feedreader.js file. The test results appears at the bottom of the index.html page.

 * Tests that are green have passed and red have failed.

## The tests:

 * tests to make sure that the allFeeds variable has been defined and that it is not empty.

 * loops through each feed and determines if the URL is defined and not empty.

 * loops through each feed and determines that each feed has a name and not empty.

 * ensures the menu element is hidden by default.

 * validates proper functioning of the hamburger menu toggle.

 * tests that there is at least one entry in feed.

 * tests that new content is loaded by loadFeed().


### How to run this test:

 * Simply visit here, I publicly hosted this test.


### How to run the this locally

#### Option - Simple:

 * Open the folder

 * Open index.html on your preferred browser
